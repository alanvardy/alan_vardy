Want to do make an offsite backup? Heard the horror stories of what happens when Digital Ocean cuts you off (hint: you lose access to your backups too).

rsync to the rescue!

This command will transfer the folder, will all files inside, to the destination folder. In this case I am putting the dokku home folder (which contains all my Dokku containers) in my downloads folder.

```bash
rsync -azP --delete root@YOUR.IP.ADDRESS.HERE:/home/dokku ~/Downloads/
```
